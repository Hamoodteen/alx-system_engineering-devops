# Postmortem: The Great Banana Outage of 2024

## Issue Summary
- **Duration**: From **March 3, 2024, 10:00 PM (UTC)** to **March 4, 2024, 2:30 AM (UTC)**.
- **Impact**: The **Banana Delivery Service (BDS)** experienced a complete outage, affecting all users who rely on timely banana deliveries. Approximately **87%** of our users were affected.
- **Root Cause**: A **banana-peel-induced cascading failure** in our backend infrastructure.

## Timeline
- **10:00 PM (UTC)**: Issue detected by our monitoring system when the **banana delivery queue** suddenly stalled.
- **10:15 PM (UTC)**: An engineer noticed the slowdown while munching on a banana and promptly raised an alert.
- **10:30 PM (UTC)**: Investigation began. Assumptions included **network congestion**, **banana ripeness fluctuations**, and **monkey strikes**.
- **11:00 PM (UTC)**: Debugging paths led us down a rabbit hole of **banana-related puns**. We suspected a **banana split** in our load balancer.
- **12:00 AM (UTC)**: Escalated to the **FruitOps** team, who were initially skeptical but took it seriously.
- **1:00 AM (UTC)**: After peeling back layers of code, we discovered the **banana peel** stuck in the server rack.
- **2:30 AM (UTC)**: The incident was resolved by carefully removing the peel and rebooting the affected servers.

## Root Cause and Resolution
### Root Cause
- The **banana peel** had slipped through the cracks (literally) during a routine server maintenance.
- It lodged itself into the **critical cooling fan** of our main database server.
- The fan's reduced efficiency caused **overheating**, leading to **database connection timeouts**.

### Resolution
- We removed the **banana peel** and cleaned the affected components.
- The database servers were rebooted, and the **banana peel** was properly disposed of.
- We added **banana-proof mesh guards** to prevent future incidents.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
1. **Banana Awareness Training**:
    - Conduct mandatory training for all engineers on **banana-related risks**.
    - Emphasize the importance of **peel detection** during server maintenance.
2. **Monitoring Enhancements**:
    - Set up alerts for **unusual fruit presence** near critical infrastructure.
    - Monitor **banana ripeness levels** to predict potential failures.
3. **Banana-Free Zones**:
    - Designate specific areas where bananas are not allowed.
    - Implement strict **banana quarantine** protocols.
4. **Banana Incident Response Playbook**:
    - Create a playbook for handling future **fruit-related emergencies**.
    - Include steps for **peel extraction**, **banana disposal**, and **fan cleaning**.

## Conclusion
The Great Banana Outage of 2024 taught us that even the most unlikely culprits can disrupt our services. Let's stay vigilant, keep our servers **peel-free**, and ensure smooth banana deliveries for all! üçåüöö
